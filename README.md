Title: Eye Exercise

Description: The Eye Exercise shows a pair of eyes that will follow your cursor when it is moved about the screen. The eyes are also set to blink at a random interval between a half second and eight seconds.

How to Run: In order to run the eye exercise, download index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser and watch the eyes follow your cursor, as well as blink at random intervals.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it may be fun for the user to be able to costumize the eyes to their liking.
